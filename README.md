Got it. Since you confirmed the specific APIs from the PDF, I'll update the README.md to be precise about those integrations, making your hackathon project look even more thorough.

Here is the revised and final README.md for your Flask Expense Management System.

->> Flask Expense Management System (Hackathon Project)
Project Overview
This project was developed during the Odoo Virtual Hackathon (Oct 4, 2025) as a custom, Python-based Expense Management Solution using the Flask framework. It directly addresses the problem of manual, time-consuming expense reporting by implementing a highly flexible, multi-level, and conditional approval workflow.

->> Core Features Implemented
1. Advanced Approval Workflow (The Core Challenge)
The system implements a powerful, customizable approval engine to manage multi-level sign-offs and conditional rules.


Multi-Level Sequential Flow: The Admin defines a sequence of approvers (e.g., Manager → Finance → Director). Expenses only move to the next approver after the current one approves.




Conditional Approval Rules: The engine supports complex, automated decision-making:


Percentage Rule: If a percentage of approvers (e.g., 60%) approve, the expense is approved.


Specific Approver Rule: If a designated approver (e.g., CFO) approves, the expense is auto-approved.


Hybrid Rule: Combines both rules (e.g., 60% OR CFO approval).

2. Expense Submission & Currency Handling

Flexible Submission: Employees can submit claims with an amount that may be in a currency different from the company's base currency.

API Integration for Financial Accuracy:


Currency Conversion: Uses https://api.exchangerate-api.com/v4/latest/{BASE_CURRENCY} to convert foreign expense amounts to the company's default currency.


Initial Setup: Uses https://restcountries.com/v3.1/all?fields=name,currencies to correctly set the auto-created Company's base currency.


3. User Management and Roles
The system implements distinct roles: 

Admin, Manager, and Employee.



Initial Setup: A new Company and Admin User are automatically created on first login/signup.


Admin Duties: The Admin can define manager relationships and roles.

->> Stretch Goal Implemented: OCR Integration

Receipt Auto-Read: A service was implemented to simulate scanning a receipt, allowing the system to use an OCR algorithm to autogenerate the expense details (amount, date, description, etc.).
